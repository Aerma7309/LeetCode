# Leetcode

Leetcode is a website where people–mostly software engineers–practice their coding skills. There are 1400+ questions \(and growing\), each with multiple solutions. Questions are ranked by level of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.

Similar websites include HackerRank, Topcoder, InterviewBit, among others. There’s also a popular book, “Cracking the Coding Interview,” which some call the Bible for engineers. The Blind community uses a mix of these resources, but based on mentions, LeetCode seems to be the most popular. Our active users cite the following reasons for preferring LeetCode: more questions, better quality, plus a strong user base.
